At the onset of this moment, when we are going to voice our thoughts about the behavior of others, whether it's my daughter and I, you by yourself in your head, or anyone in really any circumstance, we are entering a judgmental space by it's literal definition. \n\nAny way to frame, or speak about some else's actions requires judgments to be made. Our society has made the word 'judgmental' have strong negative connotations, and I believe people are uncomfortable with using others as teaching opportunities for fear of being \"judgmental\" \n\nHere's an example of what I'm talking about. Daughter and I see a child screaming in the market, jumping up and down creating a massive scene, hitting their parent ect.... I'll ask my daughter \"why do you think they're being so terrible\" (I insert the view I'm teaching, that the behavior is terrible, so judgment is made) but begin a dialogue. Normally she'll say \"they're mad\" or something like that, and we'll talk about things that make us mad, what might have this other child mad,  I'll say something like \"I get mad, you get mad, everyone get's mad sometimes, it's ok to be mad but that's not how we act when we're mad right?\" `yup` \n\n\"Well why do you think we don't want to act like that\" and discuss how it's disruptive and rude to other people in the store ect..\n\nI believe we should be creating a template for judgment to exist, where it's where the person's identity isn't attacked, but their behavior and actions (content of their character) are understood and discussed. \n\nWhere we incorporate lessons of what, and what not do from others as well as we do from ourselves, and judge things in a manner that's kind to the individual, (not attacking their identity) that's with mercy (understanding we all experience these things) with logic and fairness  (by being honest about how those behaviors impact others around).\n--------\nThe person who could change my view would do so by showing me how this style of parenting causes more harm than good and I shouldn't have a conversation with my daughter making judgments about the misbehaving child. \n\n\nEDIT- after reading lots of really amazing responses I have learned a few things. Firstly that framing things this way (with some of the specific language) could be bad for my daughter because when she steps out of line, she inserts herself as the \"terrible\" child, or that she is doing \"terrible things\", which may be true by whatever definition we have for terrible, it can damage self esteem and doesn't promote healthy learning. \n\n2ndly there is a problem with syntax and semantics with the term judgment, and while none of those arguments swayed me, they are still very much relevant. \n\nLastly, it's Friday afternoon, and I'm going home. Be well. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

At the onset of this moment, when we are going to voice our thoughts about the behavior of others, whether it&amp;#39;s my daughter and I, you by yourself in your head, or anyone in really any circumstance, we are entering a judgmental space by it&amp;#39;s literal definition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any way to frame, or speak about some else&amp;#39;s actions requires judgments to be made. Our society has made the word &amp;#39;judgmental&amp;#39; have strong negative connotations, and I believe people are uncomfortable with using others as teaching opportunities for fear of being &amp;quot;judgmental&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example of what I&amp;#39;m talking about. Daughter and I see a child screaming in the market, jumping up and down creating a massive scene, hitting their parent ect.... I&amp;#39;ll ask my daughter &amp;quot;why do you think they&amp;#39;re being so terrible&amp;quot; (I insert the view I&amp;#39;m teaching, that the behavior is terrible, so judgment is made) but begin a dialogue. Normally she&amp;#39;ll say &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;re mad&amp;quot; or something like that, and we&amp;#39;ll talk about things that make us mad, what might have this other child mad,  I&amp;#39;ll say something like &amp;quot;I get mad, you get mad, everyone get&amp;#39;s mad sometimes, it&amp;#39;s ok to be mad but that&amp;#39;s not how we act when we&amp;#39;re mad right?&amp;quot; &lt;code&gt;yup&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well why do you think we don&amp;#39;t want to act like that&amp;quot; and discuss how it&amp;#39;s disruptive and rude to other people in the store ect..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe we should be creating a template for judgment to exist, where it&amp;#39;s where the person&amp;#39;s identity isn&amp;#39;t attacked, but their behavior and actions (content of their character) are understood and discussed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Where we incorporate lessons of what, and what not do from others as well as we do from ourselves, and judge things in a manner that&amp;#39;s kind to the individual, (not attacking their identity) that&amp;#39;s with mercy (understanding we all experience these things) with logic and fairness  (by being honest about how those behaviors impact others around).&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The person who could change my view would do so by showing me how this style of parenting causes more harm than good and I shouldn&amp;#39;t have a conversation with my daughter making judgments about the misbehaving child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT- after reading lots of really amazing responses I have learned a few things. Firstly that framing things this way (with some of the specific language) could be bad for my daughter because when she steps out of line, she inserts herself as the &amp;quot;terrible&amp;quot; child, or that she is doing &amp;quot;terrible things&amp;quot;, which may be true by whatever definition we have for terrible, it can damage self esteem and doesn&amp;#39;t promote healthy learning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2ndly there is a problem with syntax and semantics with the term judgment, and while none of those arguments swayed me, they are still very much relevant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it&amp;#39;s Friday afternoon, and I&amp;#39;m going home. Be well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We&amp;#39;d like to remind you of a couple of things.

And indeed, this is what Netflix wants, and I do love their original shows.  But it isn't replacing cable for me.  I don't really watch their movie/TV show selection much anymore because I've already seen most of what I'm interested in.  Narcos and Stranger Things and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are great, but they are just fleshing out the lineup of shows I like in conjunction with all the other shows that I can only get with my $100 a month cable subscription.  I also like to watch the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones and the news.  If I want to watch the new Star Trek, now I have to shell out even more money for another subscription service.  If I want to watch sports I need either an expensive subscription ($40+ just for sports) or my normal cable subscription.  Now Disney is starting their own subscription service as well.  If I want Hulu's offerings, that is another subscription.

Fair enough.  But that isn't really fulfilling *my* dream of cable cutting.  I didn't envision that these services would morph into a low budget option for people who can live with less content than they used to get.  In fact, I suspect that in this age of streaming options, most people will spend roughly the same amount for TV entertainment as before.  Because most people I know are still going to keep their cable subscription, and supplement it with a couple streaming options of their choice.  Realistically, I don't think we are in for an age of drastically lower prices.  It is a great option for a low budget or a college kid who can now get a LOT of value for $10 a month, but I bet the average person doesn't save any money in this new age of streaming.\n\nEDIT:  So after reading all of your really well thought out comments, I still think I retain my view.  However, I do have a greater understanding of what cable cutting is for most people.  I appreciate more that Netflix's trajectory is just fine for a lot of people.  And that if you don't care about certain specific aspects of live TV (news, sports, etc), then it really is possible to pay less and get rid of your cable bill.  But I still believe that we aren't really in a new paradigm of cable cutting like some predicted. Until subscription services are the default instead of cable, most people I know (for what it's worth...) are going to keep both.  And due to realities of the business that many of you pointed out, it isn't Netflix's goal to fill every niche.

Maybe so, but I think proper laws against politicians who use their position wrongly, or get there by lying to the public and giving false promises, and truly implementing these laws would be overall beneficiary to any country. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks guys for your input.

I am trying to build up 300 Karma so I can ask for assistance on my family on /r/assistance.  Even after a year, I am struggling to build even 200ish Karma up.   People say Karma doesn't matter, but in our case it does.  I am not asking for upvotes, merely that you do not harm this pursuit.  I realize the view I hold may be considered unkind, but what me and my whole family need at this point is kindness.\n\nI became physically disabled in 2008, total and permanent disability awarded through SSA.  Years go by and my wife developed stage-IV lung cancer (despite never smoking) while pregnant at the age of 29.  She is very likely to die and leave me with three kids (all under age 7) that I will struggle (putting it mildly) to support.  I attempt to go back to work (because she couldn't anymore), after trying my absolute hardest it worsens my condition and I just got laid off due to lack of productivity.  Since I earned significant income in my attempt, SSA revoked my disability, upon trying to have it re-instated SSA informed me my attempts to re-apply for benefits will fail.  My family and social network in general has struggles of their own, at capacity in their willingness to help us.  At the rate things are going, we are going to be homeless, my wife will be dead and my children will be taken away by social services.  I cannot work at this point and I have no prospective income in the foreseeable future.\n\nI get the impression that all people are struggling to some degree, otherwise they would help us more.  Struggling is largely accepted, human biases naturally make people less inclined to help those in need.  Like assuming others might help-like god maybe?   I hear all the time from my friends that god has a plan.  That god's trying to teach us something with this cancer battle.  That everything will work out, trust in god.  That maybe we're not right with god and have invited demons to oppress our household.  When things go good for my friends, they praise god for favoring them and rewarding their faith.  When things go wrong for us, they just pray for us, without any effect.  When I walk into the halls of MD Anderson Cancer Treatment Center (almost daily), the absence of god is glaringly obvious to me.  Young mothers, little children- all dying, horribly maimed by cancer, they are horribly disfigured and horrific numbers of amputations of every variety. How can this be part of god's plan?  What can these poor people learn?  What omnipotent being comes up with suffering as a way of \"soul-making\" or any other theodicy I've heard people make for these atrocities, his apparent indifference?\n\nThe reality is there is no god.  The universe is precisely what a scientist would expect to see if there were no intelligent creator behind it.  It's a random ensemble of physical laws that just happened to give rise to conscious life, giving it the mere appearance of fine tuning.  I would expect more from an omnipotent god. I would argue that an omnipotent being could make a world free of suffering, where free-will did not comprise a world where people's exercise of free will would anger him, provoking him into creating this painful existence.  Conscious beings wouldn't have to kill and eat/pain other conscious beings for survival, the bible would be this perfect literary work and not rife with glaring contradictions and condoning morally questionable acts that were once acceptable for the time.  In our case, we did not earn our misfortune, just some people by random chance have everything go wrong.  As unlikely as it is (and indeed unlikely as our specific universe/laws are,) roll the dice enough and it happens.  You'll find that a rare few people have extremely bad runs of 'luck' and conversely, a few with very good runs.  The majority will fall in the middle of good and bad things happening to them, but nothing catastrophically bad or sensationally spectacular in their lifetimes.  These people will attribute the random goings on as divine intervention, the will of god.  They will interpret massive failure they see as the result of personal failings/judgement from god.  They will interpret extreme success as brilliance with god's approval shining down.\n\nPlease change my view, I am in a horribly dark place devoid of all hope.  I have no idea on a path forward, everything I try to do is not enough to save our family.  I am trying to stave off a sense of learned helplessness at this point.  So much pain and failure despite my very best efforts.  Families silently die every day, but you just don't know- that's why it's a silent death.  I am not the silent type, I will make a desperate scream in hopes it will be heard.  My friends surround me saying god is there, I see the suffering around me (not just my own, or my family's) and it's pretty clear to me no one's home.  I don't believe in god, but if there were a god, I would be extremely angry and appalled by his apparent indifference, his negligence.\n\n&lt;EDIT 2 PMish CST&gt;  Took a short break to go eat.  All the support and counterpoints are really helping.   I just realized I haven't eaten in a very long time.  In fact, I lost 20 lbs in the last month and a half.  I'm back to responding, slow going because I'm so overwhelmed with emotions right now.\n\n&lt;EDIT 3:58 PM CST&gt; Wow I have been in a completely dark cloud.  I have been holding together in some ways, but completely broken inside.  I've just now come to the realization that my family is battle worn.  We have been fighting for two whole years now with very little time to actually enjoy life.  A very kind redditor (and really, you all have been extraordinarily kind) made a modest donation, which I am using a small portion to get the family out of the house for icecream- hopefully will boost morale around here.  Will be back in a bit.  I will be continuing to respond to everyone (here and PMs), even into the night.  I hope you all know how grateful I am.  I didn't have high hopes for today (or this post.)  Thank you.\n\n&lt;EDIT 8:34 PM CST&gt;  Been recuperating from the outing.  Being able to think more clearly, I think my emotional state took the worst nose dive around 7/11.  My back completely failed me, which was terrifying given the state of things.  Then on 7/12, I was notified I was officially being laid off.  My wife's treatment last treatment failed around a month and a half before that, requiring a new one.  Darkest place I've ever been guys, thanks for pulling me out of it.  I'm back now and answering things.   In the meantime, thanks everyone for enabling this:\n\n[http://weirdscience.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7CC35F6E-0EBE-42FF-902E-6776801966F6.jpg](http://weirdscience.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7CC35F6E-0EBE-42FF-902E-6776801966F6.jpg)\n\nGiven the state of things, I would have never imagined winding up there today.  We had a nice break, really felt like there was a bit of normalcy.  I am going to summarize everything I've learned from this, so this might one day help others feeling as I do.  Truth be told, I do feel more open-minded about things, this subreddit is doing exactly what it was meant to do.\n\n&lt;EDIT 10:15ish PM CST&gt;  Holy moly, drinking philosophy through the fire hose at the moment.  This whole thread has been amazingly educating.  Brain a bit gooey, taking a break to watch Criminal Minds with my lady.  It's our thing at the moment.  Also just figured out there's this \"Delta\" thing I haven't been tending to.  I will be going back and fixing that for all the people who contributed to changing my mind.\n\n&lt;EDIT 1 AMish CST&gt;  Been here for a while, just responding to some neglected PMs.  Might take a quick doze and see if I can actually sleep tonight, tending to a few things on this thread during periods I can't sleep.  Today has been simply incredible, I am so surprised how things have gone.  I am deeply touched and inspired.\n\n&lt;EDIT 7:34 AM CST&gt;  Holy crap I actually slept the entire night!  This hasn't happened in years!  Back at it.\n\n&lt;EDIT 11:51 AM CST&gt; Taking a break, noticed my wife's thinking is starting to spiral.  She hasn't been here yet to benefit from all the support and perspective everyone is offering in this thread.   I'm going to share the insights I derived here, just make her day a little better.  Being in a far better place now, I can more clearly see she's been in the same bad place I've been these past few months, probably for far longer than I.   Don't worry though, I am a person who values his commitments and I see everything I do to its conclusion.

In the meantime, thanks everyone for enabling this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://weirdscience.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7CC35F6E-0EBE-42FF-902E-6776801966F6.jpg\"&gt;http://weirdscience.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7CC35F6E-0EBE-42FF-902E-6776801966F6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the state of things, I would have never imagined winding up there today.  We had a nice break, really felt like there was a bit of normalcy.  I am going to summarize everything I&amp;#39;ve learned from this, so this might one day help others feeling as I do.  Truth be told, I do feel more open-minded about things, this subreddit is doing exactly what it was meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;EDIT 10:15ish PM CST&amp;gt;  Holy moly, drinking philosophy through the fire hose at the moment.  This whole thread has been amazingly educating.  Brain a bit gooey, taking a break to watch Criminal Minds with my lady.  It&amp;#39;s our thing at the moment.  Also just figured out there&amp;#39;s this &amp;quot;Delta&amp;quot; thing I haven&amp;#39;t been tending to.  I will be going back and fixing that for all the people who contributed to changing my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;EDIT 1 AMish CST&amp;gt;  Been here for a while, just responding to some neglected PMs.  Might take a quick doze and see if I can actually sleep tonight, tending to a few things on this thread during periods I can&amp;#39;t sleep.  Today has been simply incredible, I am so surprised how things have gone.  I am deeply touched and inspired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;EDIT 7:34 AM CST&amp;gt;  Holy crap I actually slept the entire night!  This hasn&amp;#39;t happened in years!  Back at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;EDIT 11:51 AM CST&amp;gt; Taking a break, noticed my wife&amp;#39;s thinking is starting to spiral.  She hasn&amp;#39;t been here yet to benefit from all the support and perspective everyone is offering in this thread.   I&amp;#39;m going to share the insights I derived here, just make her day a little better.  Being in a far better place now, I can more clearly see she&amp;#39;s been in the same bad place I&amp;#39;ve been these past few months, probably for far longer than I.   Don&amp;#39;t worry though, I am a person who values his commitments and I see everything I do to its conclusion.  Will be back tonight (to tend to this amazing thread and all the wonderful PMs) after the family goes to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "qa", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "rte_mode": "richtext", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "94k9lf", "report_reasons": null, "author": "joshingkatie", "num_crossposts": 2, "num_comments": 469, "send_replies": true, "mod_reports": [], "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/94k9lf/cmv_the_universe_indifferent_to_suffering_god_is/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/94k9lf/cmv_the_universe_indifferent_to_suffering_god_is/", "subreddit_subscribers": 589168, "created_utc": 1533399300.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "selftext": "In the college environment we are supposed to be challenging old ideas and popular opinions.

I'm struggling because, my whole life, I've wanted fairness and equality \u2013 but over the past year I've become bitter and lost. I want to help build a better world \u2013 but, because I'm white and male, I feel profoundly unwelcome in the conversation going on right now. Sometimes, I even feel scared by it. \n\nI don't need you to convince me that equality is important, or that inequalities still exist. (Of course they do.) Nor do I need to you to explain how, as a white dude, I'm privileged. (Believe me, I know.) But I am hoping you can help me see a better way forward than self-flagellation and guilt, which doesn't help me and certainly doesn't help anybody else. \n\nSo, to unpack this stuff a little:\n\nI feel worthless. Everywhere I look, I see articles about how terrible people who look like me are, and I feel ashamed. I feel guilty. I feel like I can't be proud of who I am \u2013 and I don't mean proud of my external characteristics (in the way that people sometimes say misguided stuff on here like, \"Why can't we have a 'White Pride Day'?\") but proud of who I am, deep down, as an individual person. It's hard because everywhere I look I see positive role models from other genders/races, and I want to be positive, too. But white men are pretty vilified and there's not a lot of examples on how I can be a decent person and actually help. The message I get is that I should just shut up and bask in my privilege, because society is done with me. Deep down, I'm a caring, emotional person and I'm buckling because I feel like I can't rise above the narrative in the media: that white people, men, and especially white men are just awful.\n\nI think a part of me feels like I should suffer, because of my privilege.  So I read social justice news frequently.  But I'm exhausted \u2013 enough so that small things are starting to get to me. Today, for instance, I saw an article about whether or not \"people of color\" is an acceptable term to use and I kind of lost it internally \u2013 not because I don't care if the term is acceptable or not, but because I feel like I can't be this perfect white man who never offends anyone accidentally. There are so many angry articles I've read and I'd like to say that we could all be angry about the problem but it feels like we're angry at each other. And it's making it hard for me to see myself and others as individuals \u2013 the exact opposite of what I want. These days I walk around feeling like people hate me, scared that even if they're nice to me they're just thinking the same things these articles say.\n\nIt doesn't really feel like the narrative of equality today is, \"let's build a better world together.\" It feels more like, \"white men have caused all of these problems so you guys just go sit in a corner.\" And it makes me angry, because I want to help, and I don't believe that the best way for me to help is just go bask in my privilege and die. I want to say, I'm here for this, and I want to help, but you have to let me be an individual who is imperfect and not just \"an evil white dude\". \n\nUgh. I know this is rambling and probably incoherent \u2013 the more I type, I'm getting emotional. \n\nAnyway, please try to change my view. I don't want to keep feeling shitty and wind up a bitter, Trump voter in 2020 (lol). I want to be part of this, and help, but I feel so unwelcome and lost. \n\nPS: I'm going to be here for the next few hours because I'm taking this seriously and will reply in good faith.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the productive conversation so far. I've got to step away for a little now but I'll check back in a few hours and reply some more.\n_____\n\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

I want to help build a better world \u2013 but, because I&amp;#39;m white and male, I feel profoundly unwelcome in the conversation going on right now. Sometimes, I even feel scared by it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t need you to convince me that equality is important, or that inequalities still exist. (Of course they do.) Nor do I need to you to explain how, as a white dude, I&amp;#39;m privileged. (Believe me, I know.) But I am hoping you can help me see a better way forward than self-flagellation and guilt, which doesn&amp;#39;t help me and certainly doesn&amp;#39;t help anybody else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to unpack this stuff a little:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel worthless. Everywhere I look, I see articles about how terrible people who look like me are, and I feel ashamed. I feel guilty. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t be proud of who I am \u2013 and I don&amp;#39;t mean proud of my external characteristics (in the way that people sometimes say misguided stuff on here like, &amp;quot;Why can&amp;#39;t we have a &amp;#39;White Pride Day&amp;#39;?&amp;quot;) but proud of who I am, deep down, as an individual person. It&amp;#39;s hard because everywhere I look I see positive role models from other genders/races, and I want to be positive, too. But white men are pretty vilified and there&amp;#39;s not a lot of examples on how I can be a decent person and actually help. The message I get is that I should just shut up and bask in my privilege, because society is done with me. Deep down, I&amp;#39;m a caring, emotional person and I&amp;#39;m buckling because I feel like I can&amp;#39;t rise above the narrative in the media: that white people, men, and especially white men are just awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a part of me feels like I should suffer, because of my privilege.  So I read social justice news frequently.  But I&amp;#39;m exhausted \u2013 enough so that small things are starting to get to me. Today, for instance, I saw an article about whether or not &amp;quot;people of color&amp;quot; is an acceptable term to use and I kind of lost it internally \u2013 not because I don&amp;#39;t care if the term is acceptable or not, but because I feel like I can&amp;#39;t be this perfect white man who never offends anyone accidentally. There are so many angry articles I&amp;#39;ve read and I&amp;#39;d like to say that we could all be angry about the problem but it feels like we&amp;#39;re angry at each other. And it&amp;#39;s making it hard for me to see myself and others as individuals \u2013 the exact opposite of what I want. These days I walk around feeling like people hate me, scared that even if they&amp;#39;re nice to me they&amp;#39;re just thinking the same things these articles say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t really feel like the narrative of equality today is, &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s build a better world together.&amp;quot; It feels more like, &amp;quot;white men have caused all of these problems so you guys just go sit in a corner.&amp;quot; And it makes me angry, because I want to help, and I don&amp;#39;t believe that the best way for me to help is just go bask in my privilege and die. I want to say, I&amp;#39;m here for this, and I want to help, but you have to let me be an individual who is imperfect and not just &amp;quot;an evil white dude&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ugh. I know this is rambling and probably incoherent \u2013 the more I type, I&amp;#39;m getting emotional. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, please try to change my view. I don&amp;#39;t want to keep feeling shitty and wind up a bitter, Trump voter in 2020 (lol). I want to be part of this, and help, but I feel so unwelcome and lost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I&amp;#39;m going to be here for the next few hours because I&amp;#39;m taking this seriously and will reply in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks for the productive conversation so far. I&amp;#39;ve got to step away for a little now but I&amp;#39;ll check back in a few hours and reply some more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.
